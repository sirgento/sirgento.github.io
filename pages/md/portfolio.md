### This

Yeah, I'll count this. I am trying to keep this thing responsive
and optimized enough so that I won't feel bad about myself.

### Word search game

[Repo](https://github.com/sirgento/fundprog-projeto-cacapalavra)

Assignment from uni. Had fun enough making it. Deals with IO operations,
memory management, file reads and writes and whatnot. I could only ever
get a single difficulty working, pretty buggy. But hey, I got a 9 or something!

I may or may not redo this in Rust someday.

### YAMFW.js

Yet Another MicroFramework!

I've decided to yoink the JS used to make the buttons up there do something from here and put
it inside a "neat enough" package, so that I can make sites for other people more easily -- and also
so that other people can use the code without having to "ask me first" or scrape it from this repo's files.
