### This

[Repo](https://github.com/sirgento/sirgento.github.io)

Yeah, I'll count this. I am trying to keep this thing responsive
and optimized enough so that I won't feel bad about myself.

### Word search game

[Repo](https://github.com/sirgento/fundprog-projeto-cacapalavra)

Assignment from uni. Had fun enough making it. Deals with IO operations,
memory management, file reads and writes and whatnot. I could only ever
get a single difficulty working, pretty buggy. But hey, I got a 9 or something!

I may or may not redo this in Rust someday.

### YAMFW.js

[Repo](https://github.com/sirgento/yamfw.js)

Yet Another MicroFramework!

I've decided to yoink the JS used to make the buttons up there do something from here and put
it inside a "neat enough" package, so that I can make sites for other people more easily -- and also
so that other people can use the code without having to "ask me first" or scrape it from this repo's files.

### LibertaGeek! website

[Site](https://liberta-geek.web.app/)

Repo is not public because firebase config and whatnot

Made this website using Firebase tools -- Firestore, Storage and Hosting -- for friends of mine who are 
involved in cosplay and geek culture, having started an event aggregator company for our geographic region.
It uses a modified YAMFW to fetch the `.md` file from Firebase Storage, and some vanilla JS templating 
to pull the events from Firestore, so that it'd'nt be a hassle to add or remove content. It also uses a 
vanilla YAMFW to pull some aditional content into the main page, because again, less of a hassle.
