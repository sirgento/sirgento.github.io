### Me

I am a *twice* dropout from university, came back for the third time because why not. Maybe I'll get the hat trick..

I like coding, vaporwave, and am a linux user. 
Though I have tried to get Gentoo running (as my username might imply), on a veritable sh\*\*box, it proved too overwhelming for my current skill level -- I did install a Stage3 tarball and compile the kernel, but it went *too fast* and I'm sure I messed something up *big time*. 
I use Arch on my school laptop, Debian (Bookworm with Buster kernel) on a very, very legacy laptop made server, and will migrate my main machine to Nix. 
Gentoo penguins are neat, so I won't bother changing it (my username).

This is a website, but you already knew that. I really do hope it's working nicely enough in your device, to be honest
