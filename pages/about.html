  <p>
  	I am a 24 year old web developer from Brazil, currently studying Systems Development and Analysis.

	The original meaning of the "Sir Gento" nickname has been long lost, however I've adopted that it 
	would be a typo of "Sir Gentoo", as in the penguin, not because I use the Gentoo Linux distro,
	but because penguins are cool.
